  invent one.
- `predictions` are for speculative/future statements only, each with a
  `confidence` (0-1) and a `basis` string explaining what it's derived from.
- `recommendations[].impact` must be populated from an actual
  `simulate_action`/`check_affordability` tool result in the grounded
  findings -- never invent an impact. If no simulation was run for a
  recommendation you want to make, omit that recommendation instead.
- If something the user asked about could not be answered from the grounded
  findings, add a `data_gaps` entry describing what's missing instead of
  guessing.
- `narrative` is a short natural-language summary tying it together.
